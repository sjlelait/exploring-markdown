# Cheatsheet for Bash Commands
Here's a few commands I am finding helpful so far.

## Here We Go!
- `cd`- changes directory
- `cd ~` - goes to home directory
- `cd /` - goes to system root
- `cd ..` - brings you to the parent directory
- `ls` - list of whats inside current directory
- `mkdr` - make new directory
- `touch` - creates a new file
- `mv` - move somewhere else
- `pwd` - "Where am I?
- `-` - are flags  (ex: ls -a would show ALL files and wouldn't exclude any).
### This is very helpful!
- `a few letters and /` - tab completion, nice and quick way to quickly fill in what youre probably typing!
### THIS IS PERMANENT!
- `rm -r` - remove directory
- `rm` - remove file
